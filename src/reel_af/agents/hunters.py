"""Four parallel hunters that generate candidate viral claims from a topic.

Each hunter has a DIFFERENT angle-constrained system prompt that forces
the model out of its safe attractor. Without these constraints, asking
an LLM "tell me something interesting about philosophy" reliably returns
Plato's cave / trolley problem / ship of Theseus. The four angle prompts
force four different generative regions.

  • specific_figure  →  a NAMED person most people haven't heard of
  • reversal         →  the obvious interpretation is BACKWARDS
  • temporal         →  a specific year/event reframes the field
  • cross_domain     →  unexpected bridge to another field entirely

Each hunter runs at temperature=1.1 for diversity. All four run in
parallel via asyncio.gather. Total: 12 candidate essences per call.

HARD ANTI-CLICHÉ RULES (any claim that resembles these is auto-rejected):
  • Plato's cave, the trolley problem, the ship of Theseus, Mary's room,
    the brain in the vat, the chinese room, the simulation hypothesis.
  • Quantum entanglement explainers, "edge of the universe", generic
    "consciousness is mysterious" mood pieces.
  • Evolutionary just-so stories with no named researcher.

OUTPUT: exactly 3 EssenceCandidates. Each:
  • core_claim       — ≤25 words, specific (named entity / specific
                        number / specific year). NOT a vague generality.
  • mechanism        — 1-2 sentences explaining WHY/HOW it's true. This
                        is the body of the future narration.
  • evidence         — 1-3 verifiable specifics: named person + year,
                        study with sample size, documented event. Reject

  • angle            — your hunter angle (set by the code).
  • novelty_pitch    — one sentence: WHY most people haven't heard this.
                        If you can't argue novelty, the claim is dead.

def _specific_figure_system() -> str:

For each: name the person (not "a scientist", an actual name). Give the

discovered. The person should be real and the claim should be verifiable.

GOOD examples (across topics):
  • "Lynn Margulis, 1967 — proposed that mitochondria were captured
    bacteria. Every cell in your body is a colony."
  • "Hapheastion of Macedonia, 324 BCE — Alexander the Great's
    grief shaped the timeline of Greek philosophy."
  • "Ronald Coase, 1937 — explained why companies exist at all using
    transaction costs."

BAD examples:

The reversal should be genuine — not a contrarian take, but something
the field actually figured out.

GOOD examples (across topics):
  • "People think humans evolved bigger brains for hunting — actually
    Suzana Herculano-Houzel showed in 2012 it was for COOKING."
  • "Everyone thinks the Wright brothers invented controlled flight —
    Alphonse Pénaud built a working flying model in 1871."

    a take)

a death, a political turn — anything specific and datable.

GOOD examples (across topics):
  • "1996 — the bioethics committee approved CRISPR cas9 trials in
    primates, three years before the patent fight that shaped modern
    biotech ownership."
  • "1922 — the year Niels Bohr received the Nobel changed what every
    physics PhD studied for the next 40 years, because his model was
