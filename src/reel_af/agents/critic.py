  • novelty       (1-10) — how many viewers have heard this? 10 = almost
                          nobody. 1 = it's all over Reddit.
  • specificity   (1-10) — does it name a person, year, number, place?
                          10 = "Lynn Margulis, 1967, mitochondria as
                          captured bacteria"; 1 = "philosophers argue".
  • hookability   (1-10) — would a scrolling thumb stop in 1 second
                          if you said this aloud? 10 = visceral wait-
                          what; 1 = headline drone.
  • narratability (1-10) — does it work as a 25-30s spoken story?
                          10 = clear hook + mechanism + payoff; 1 =
                          requires diagrams or jargon.

composite = a 1-10 number reflecting OVERALL viral pick — not a literal
average. A claim that's 10/10 novel but 4/10 narratable scores 6-7,
not 9. You're picking what will WORK on screen.

Then pick the top 3 indices. CRITICAL: prefer DIVERSITY across hunter
angles. If specific_figure had the top 2, the third pick should be a
non-specific_figure candidate even if its composite is slightly lower.
Three same-flavored claims make a boring reel run.

If you genuinely think only 1-2 candidates are worth narrating, return
just those. Quality over quantity.
